"""
We can scan the newest or oldest event ids with ZRANGE 4,
maybe later pulling the events themselves for analysis.

We can get the 10 or even 100 events immediately
before or after a timestamp with ZRANGEBYSCORE
combined with the LIMIT argument.

We can count the number of events that occurred
in a specific time period with ZCOUNT.
